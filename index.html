    <h1>Some Pretty Good Tequilas</h1>

    <p>This is a look at some pretty good tequilas. They aren't top=shelf so they won't
        break the bank. But they aren't bottom-of-the barrel either, not the kind of spirit you'd
        want to slam down quickly with a quick squirt of lime and a liick of salt. You want to sip
        these, relishing the flavor as they pass over your tongue, then feel the gentle warmth as they
        pass down your throat. We looked for tequilas between $30 and $50. Again, not cheap but they
        won't break the bank if you enjoy them sparingly and don't waste them.</p>
    
    <p>Our sampling will include a couple from each of the following types: Blanco (or silver), reposado,
        and añejo. In general these types refer to how long the tequila was aged as follows:</p>
    
    <table>
    <tr><th>Blanco</th><td class="blanco">Little or no aging.</td></tr></tr>
    <tr><th>Reposado</th><td class="reposado">2 to 12 months.</td></tr></tr>
    <tr><th>Añejo</th><td class="anejo">1-plus years.</td></tr></tr>
    </table>
